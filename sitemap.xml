    <ExecutiveSummary>
        After growing up in small-town Northeast Texas and graduating at the top of my class, I pursued further education and was anointed my first degree with Honors. I had the good fortune to serve for six years as a technical theatre director for three of the largest school districts in Texas, successfully growing and developing each program during my respective tenures, before being inspired to expand my capabilities into the digital space. Soon to graduate with another degree, this time in Software Engineering, I look forward to bringing my optimism, upbeat personality, resourcefulness, and determination to support your solution development team!
